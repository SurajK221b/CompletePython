Python Basic Fundamentals ‚Äì Theory & Interview Questions
‚úÖ 1. What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language, known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including:

Procedural

Object-Oriented

Functional

Developed by: Guido van Rossum
Released in: 1991
Latest version: (e.g., Python 3.x)

‚úÖ 2. Features of Python
Feature	Description
Interpreted	Executes code line by line via Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
Dynamically Typed	No need to declare variable types explicitly
High-Level	Easy to read and write code (close to human language)
Extensive Library	Rich set of standard and third-party libraries
Cross-Platform	Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS
Open Source	Freely available and community-driven

‚úÖ 3. Python Execution Flow
text
Copy
Edit
Your Code (.py) 
‚û°Ô∏è Compiled to Bytecode (.pyc) 
‚û°Ô∏è Interpreted by Python Virtual Machine (PVM) 
‚û°Ô∏è Output
Python is not compiled to native machine code.

Bytecode improves performance slightly, but Python is still slower than compiled languages.

‚úÖ 4. Python Identifiers
Names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.

Rules:

Can contain letters, digits, and underscores

Cannot start with a digit

Cannot be a keyword

Case-sensitive (Name ‚â† name)

‚úÖ 5. Python Keywords
Reserved words that have special meaning.

Examples:
if, else, elif, while, for, break, continue, import, from, as, def, class, try, except, True, False, None

To list all:

python
Copy
Edit
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
‚úÖ 6. Variables
Created on assignment (x = 10)

Dynamically typed (no need to declare type)

Python uses references, not direct memory values

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
name = "Suraj"
age = 30
‚úÖ 7. Comments in Python
Single-line comment: # This is a comment

Multi-line (docstring): '''This is a docstring''' or """This is a docstring"""

‚úÖ 8. Indentation
Mandatory in Python (replaces braces {} from other languages)

Standard: 4 spaces per block (tabs discouraged)

Used to define blocks: if, loops, functions, classes, etc.

Incorrect:

python
Copy
Edit
if True:
print("Hello")  # IndentationError
Correct:

python
Copy
Edit
if True:
    print("Hello")
‚úÖ 9. Input and Output
print() ‚Äì Output
python
Copy
Edit
print("Hello, World!")
print("Name:", name)
input() ‚Äì Input
python
Copy
Edit
user_input = input("Enter something: ")
Always returns string

Cast to another type if needed:

python
Copy
Edit
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
‚úÖ 10. Type Casting
Function	Purpose
int()	Convert to integer
float()	Convert to float
str()	Convert to string
bool()	Convert to boolean

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
x = int("5")  # 5
‚úÖ 11. Escape Sequences
Sequence	Meaning
\n	Newline
\t	Tab
\\	Backslash
\'	Single Quote
\"	Double Quote

‚úÖ 12. Python Operators (Basics)
Type	Operators
Arithmetic	+, -, *, /, %, **
Comparison	==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical	and, or, not
Assignment	=, +=, -=, *=, etc.
Identity	is, is not
Membership	in, not in

‚úÖ 13. Code Blocks & Control Flow Basics
If-Else:
python
Copy
Edit
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
While Loop:
python
Copy
Edit
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
For Loop:
python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
‚úÖ 14. Interview Questions ‚Äì Python Fundamentals Only
üìò Theoretical
What is Python and what are its key features?

Explain Python‚Äôs execution flow.

Why is indentation important in Python?

Is Python compiled or interpreted?

What is PVM (Python Virtual Machine)?

How is memory managed in Python?

üß™ Code-Based
What is the output of:

python
Copy
Edit
print("5" + "5")
‚Üí '55' (string concatenation)

What will this code print?

python
Copy
Edit
x = 5
y = "5"
print(x + int(y))
‚Üí 10

Identify the error:

python
Copy
Edit
if True
    print("Hi")
‚Üí SyntaxError: Missing colon

What happens if you don‚Äôt indent code correctly?
‚Üí IndentationError
